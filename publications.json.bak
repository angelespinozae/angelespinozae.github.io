      "abstract": "This paper examines how the expansion of Mexico City's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system affects consumer prices across different types of retail establishments. Using high-frequency price data and a difference-in-differences approach, I find that improved public transportation infrastructure leads to heterogeneous price responses: chain stores reduce prices due to increased competition and consumer access, while street vendors and mom-and-pop stores exhibit different pricing strategies. The results highlight the importance of transportation infrastructure in shaping local market competition and consumer welfare.",

      "abstract": "We study the environmental impact of Mexico City's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system on local air quality. Using detailed pollution monitoring data and the staggered rollout of BRT lines, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate the causal effect of improved public transportation on air pollution. Our findings suggest significant reductions in key pollutants near BRT stations, with important implications for urban transportation policy in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are prevalent and increasingly complex. This paper analyzes firms' strategic responses to the stricter Rules of Origin (RoO) for the automotive industry introduced during the renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA). Using Mexican customs administrative data, we demonstrate that tighter RoO increased the share of Mexican exports to the U.S. subject to tariffs and prompted car manufacturers in Mexico to source more inputs from North America. Consistent with existing theoretical predictions, we find that firms respond strategically based on how close they were ex-ante to comply with new RoO: firms that already complied or were far from complying respond the least, and therefore, the effect on inputs sourced from the region exhibits an inverse U-shape. Finally, we show that these higher costs are passed on to consumers: among cars sold in the United States, those that were not ex-ante compliant with USMCA saw prices rise by an additional 2\% compared to vehicles that were.",
